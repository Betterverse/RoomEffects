RoomEffects plugin for Bukkit.

RoomEffects allows you to create a formation of certain blocks, all within a certain distance away from eachother, to trigger some sort of event.

Dev:
To add a new room, create a new class extending net.betterverse.RoomEffects.Scanner and in the constructor of that class, set the required blocks and amounts, and the scan limit. Use a command, or listener to trigger the scan checkRoom, which returns a success boolean.
Create a new instance of this class from Main, registering events/commands as required.
